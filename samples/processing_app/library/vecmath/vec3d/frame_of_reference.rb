    # Using each Triangle normal (N),
    # One of the Triangle's edges as a tangent (T)
    # Calculate a bi-normal (B) using the cross-product between each N and T
    # Note caps represent constants in ruby so we used N = nn, T = tt and B = bb in the ruby code below

    #
    # A picture helps
    # nice, sweet orthogonal axes

    # N   B

    # |/____T

    #
    # N, T, B together give you a Frame of Reference (cute little local coordinate system), based on each triangle.
    # You can then take the cylinder (or any vertices) and transform them using a 3 x 3 matrix to this coordinate system.
    # (In the matrix each column is based on N, T and B respecivley.)
    # The transform will handle any rotations and scaling, but not the translation,
    # but we can add another dimenson to the matrix to hold the translation values.
    # Here's what all this confusing description looks like:

    #
    # Matrix :                               Vector :
    # |  N.x  T.x  B.x  translation.x  |      |  x  |
    # |  N.y  T.y  B.y  translation.y  |      |  y  |
    # |  N.z  T.z  B.z  translation.z  |      |  z  |
    # |  0    0    0    1              |      |  1  |

    # We add the extra row in the matrix and the 1 to each vector
    # so the math works. We describe the Matrix as 4 rows by 4 columns
    # and the vector now as a Matrix with 4 rows and 1 column.
    # When you multiply matrices the inner numbers MUST match, so:
    # [4 x 4] [4 x 1] is OK, but [4 x 4] [1 x 4] is NOT COOL.

    # (Please note there is also row vector approach that you can
    # Google about; it simply puts the vector on left side of matrix and treats
    # it as a 1 row and 4 column matrix. However, you'll also need to shift
    # the translation terms to the bottom of the matrix for the math to grock.)

    # The Matrix multiplication looks like this (sorry it's a little tedious looking.)
    # n.x * x + t.x *y + B.x * z + translation.x * 1  =  new transformed x
    # n.y * x + t.y *y + B.y * z + translation.y * 1  =  new transformed y
    # n.z * x + t.z *y + B.z * z + translation.z * 1  =  new transformed z
    # 0 * x + 0 *y + 0 * z + 1 * 1   =   disregard this crap.
