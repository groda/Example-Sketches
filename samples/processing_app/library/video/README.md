###README

Some sketches in this folder may need to be run with the "--nojruby" flag. If you are using processing-3.0+ you will need to install the video library from processing.org (since it is no longer included in the vanilla processing distro) this is easiest done from the processing ide, see the [Dan Shiffman video][] on video capture.

NB: `captureEvent` is not available in ruby-processing (but you could probably write your own callback?)
