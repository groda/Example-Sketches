# HTTP Client. 
# 
# Starts a network client that connects to a server on port 80,
# sends an HTTP 1.0 GET request, and prints the results. 
# Note that this code is not necessary for simple HTTP GET request:
# Simply calling load_strings("http://www.processing.org") would do
# the same thing as (and more efficiently than) this example.
# This example is for people who might want to do something more 
# complicated later.
