### README

These sketches probably require --nojruby flag, it is a IO permission thing with jruby.
To use the convenience of just using a bare image name (rather than full path) sketch should be run from their own directory.  Further the images etc need to be in the data folder this should be obvious. But some morons are reporting this a as problem that they have "fixed" on stackoverload possibly with the wxpress aim of gaining kudos, this is clearly pants and will kill OSS.
