### README

These sketches probably require --nojruby flag, it is a IO permission thing with jruby.
To use the convenience of just using a bare image name (rather than the full path) sketches should be run from their own directory.  Further the images etc need to be in the 'data' folder (just look at the examples), this should be obvious. But some morons are reporting this as a problem that they or their mates have "fixed" on stackoverload possibly with the express aim of gaining kudos, this is clearly pants and the sort of attitude that harms OSS projects.
