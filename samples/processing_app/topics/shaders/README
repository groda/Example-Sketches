Recently I needed to use an external jruby to get some sketches to run OK (otherwise I got method missing errors see external_library/fisica). I thought I may be able to get rid of the included jruby-complete, until I tried to run the shader examples in this folder. I got java lang null pointer exception for these sketches and a few others (notably planets.rb in the demo folder). Needeless to say these sketches run OK using the included jruby-complete!!!
