Example-Sketches
================

Many of the vanilla processing example sketches have been translated to ruby-processing, and they are mainly written as 'bare' sketches (ie not class wrapped) in keeping with the original processing.  When these sketches the get wrapped in a Sketch class. Should you prefer to write class wrapped sketches these will work equally well with ruby processing. Certain sketch must be run with JRuby-Complete (`load_image` and `shader` sketches), this is some java permissions thing with jruby.
